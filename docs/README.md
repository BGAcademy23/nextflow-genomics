# Introduction to NextFlow for genomics

This session is part of [**Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023**](https://BGA23.org)

## Session Leader(s)

Solenne Correard  
Canada Biogenome Project  
Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre

I did my PhD in France studying the dog genome (mostly the non-coding part), followed by a post-doc on the Silent Genomes Project, a project aiming to reduce health care disparities and improve diagnostic success for children with rare genetic diseases from Indigenous populations in Canada. I am now leading the bioinformatic analysis for the Canadian BioGenome Project.

## Description

The session will last for about 1h30, and will be split in 2 parts of about 40 min each (we'll take a 10 min break in the middle).

Each part will include an introduction, some coding and hopefully many questions and discussion!

Outline of the session :

- Nextflow (Part 1) : What is it? When should I use it? How do I use it? 

Practice : Writing your first Nextflow pipeline to generate a contig assembly. 

- NF-core (Part 2): What is it? When should I use it? How do I use it? 

Practice : Use NF-core tools to assess the quality of the generated assembly. 

- Conclusion: Resources to learn more about Nextflow and NF-core and how to take part in the community.

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Read a nextflow pipeline and modify it
2. Write a basic nextflow pipeline
3. Use a nf-core pipeline
4. How to join the nextflow / nf-core community

The outline may change if I come up with a better idea while generating the material!

## Prerequisites

1. Expertise with linux command line basics (`cd`, `mv`, `rm`, `wget`, `curl` etc)
2. Understanding of bash scripts, and the need for bioinformatics workflows
3. Understand the general role and input/output files of the following tools : (hifiasm HiFi only)[https://hifiasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pa-assembly.html], (Quast)[https://github.com/ablab/quast], (multiQC)[https://multiqc.info]
